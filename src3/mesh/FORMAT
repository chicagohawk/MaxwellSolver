number-of-tags
    gives the number of integer tags that follow for the n-th element. By default, the first tag is the number of the physical entity to which the element belongs; the second is the number of the elementary geometrical entity to which the element belongs; the third is the number of mesh partitions to which the element belongs, followed by the partition ids (negative partition ids indicate ghost cells). A zero tag is equivalent to no tag.
